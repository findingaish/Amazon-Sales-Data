# Analyzing Amazon Sales Data

## Overview

This Python project aims to analyze sales data from Amazon to gain insights into sales performance, trends, and factors influencing sales. Sales management plays a crucial role in commercial and business enterprises, as it helps in meeting competition, reducing costs, and increasing profits. By analyzing Amazon sales data, we can identify patterns, optimize strategies, and make informed decisions to enhance sales performance.

## Problem Statement

Sales management is essential for businesses to thrive in competitive markets. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze Amazon sales data and extract valuable insights that can aid in sales management. By understanding sales patterns, identifying key factors affecting sales, and predicting future sales trends, businesses can optimize their sales strategies and improve overall performance.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project consists of sales data obtained from Amazon. It includes information such as product details, sales volumes, prices, customer ratings, and other relevant metrics. 
## Project Structure
